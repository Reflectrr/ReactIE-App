A particularly attractive aspect of this ap-proach is that it would afford a neutral method for the synthesis of allylic ethers fromwidely available and stable precursors.23In an initial demonstration of this hypothesis, we chose to evaluate chromene-based acetals for the preparation of 2-substituted 2H-chromenes (Scheme 1). Subjecting 2-ethoxy-2H-chromene 1a to 10mol%Ni(cod)2, 10mol% PPh3, and 2 equiv of p-fluorophenyl boronic acid at rt in dioxane/t-AmOH as solvent afforded the desired cross-coupled heterocycle 3 in 92% yield (Figure 2). In the absence of the Ni catalyst, 3 was not observed, even when the reaction was conducted at elevated temperatures (<5% yield).",
